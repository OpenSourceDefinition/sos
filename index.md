Dear Open Source Friends & Allies,

For over two decades, the Open Source Definition (OSD) has been our shared foundation, safeguarding software freedoms and fostering a collaborative ecosystem. Forked from the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), but until now aligned with them, the OSD has consistently set the standard for Open Source. Yet today, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has introduced a new and divisive [Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) 1.0](https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition), developed through closed-door processes that fundamentally conflict with the principles of openness and transparency that underpin our movement. Broadly covering any software that "infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs", the OSAID is in direct conflict with the existing standard, failing in both openness and completeness dimensions.

## Stewardship Challenges

The OSI’s handling of OSAID has highlighted longstanding issues. Over recent years, OSI’s governance has faced criticism for not fully representing community interests, with controversies including co-founder departures & bans, and board member resignations. By neglecting trends like cloud computing (the shift from products to services), and the growing importance of data, including AI models (but also audio, video, images, and databases), the OSI has overlooked essential aspects of modern software. Now, with OSAID, OSI is attempting to redefine the concept of openness itself—this time with little regard for feedback that doesn’t align with its predetermined approach to data. By their own admission, "a process that is not open cannot be trusted to produce a product that can be considered open".

## The Four Essential Freedoms

At the heart of Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) are the Four Essential Freedoms, which was one point the OSAID did get right:

1.	The freedom to **use** the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.
2.	The freedom to **study** how the system works and inspect its components.
3.	The freedom to **modify** the system for any purpose, including to change its output.
4.	The freedom to **share** the system for others to use, with or without modifications, for any purpose.

These freedoms ensure that users—not just vendors—retain control over software, allowing them to use, study, modify, and share it as they see fit, and to "stand on the shoulders of giants" in creating derivative works. That ends here with OSAID, which fails to fully protect these freedoms by no longer making access to the Open Source moniker conditional on having access to the requisite data.

## Openness and Completeness

There are two dimensions to the Open Source Definition: **openness** and **completeness**. Its openness credentials are already well-established, but completeness is implicit, and challenged by increasing system complexity and number of components that may need to be included under Open Source licenses to protect the four freedoms. For example, a travel guide that includes OpenStreetMap (ODbL licensed) and Wikivoyage (CC-BY-SA licensed) data is Open Source, but the "batteries not included" application source code with no data (or proprietary data) is a vassal. This is particularly true of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, where the inference code is little more than a life support system for the model.

According to Bruce Perens (original author of the OSD), "*the data is the source code*", and he asserts “*you can apply the original Open Source Definition to machine learning*”. He warned that when data and models aren’t accessible, “*the result is less than Open Source.*” This suggests that the existing standard already covers the evolving needs of machine learning without modification, and that the new document is unnecessary.

While the default position is to make no changes to the standard at all, it is also important to ensure that it remains relevant and comprehensive. One area for potential exploration is an expansion of scope to cover data, but this would have to be approached with the same high-bar standards as a constitutional amendment, requiring broad consensus and careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences. That has not been the case with OSAID, which presents considerable risks to existing projects and future innovation alike.

## Aviate, Navigate, Communicate

In aviation, when pilots encounter an emergency, they follow three steps: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. This approach applies here as well, helping us regain control, plot a safe path forward, and improve communications.

1.	*Aviate*: The first step is to pull the plane out of the dive and regain stability. First and foremost, this means maintaining the integrity of the OSD. The new Open Source Definition site [https://opensourcedefinition.org](https://opensourcedefinition.org) serves as a life raft, preserving the current Open Source Definition documentation and artefacts required for the function of the Open Source ecosystem, plus additional features like a version history and a Git repository. We encourage everyone to clone and widely distribute this CC-BY licensed document, cementing its availability throughout the community.
2.	*Navigate*: With stability restored, we can carefully assess whether to stay the course should the current path still serve all facets of Open Source. After two decades the community may agree to expand the OSD’s scope in new areas—such as data and machine learning—without disrupting existing projects, or it may consider changes not worth the significant risk. Stability remains the default, and any amendments must respect the Four Core Freedoms, avoiding unnecessary disruptions to established norms. The community must drive this process, and in light of heavy-handed censorship in the existing forums, we offer uncensored equivalents at [https://discuss.opensourcedefinition.org](https://discuss.opensourcedefinition.org) which are open to all, ensuring every voice can be heard.
3.	*Communicate*: Finally, we must engage with and educate those who rely on Open Source, whether or not they choose to participate in the process. A meaningful Open Source Definition is the foundation of lives and livelihoods, research, and enterprises across the globe, connected by the Open Source ecosystem that sustains the internet, cloud services, AI systems, and more. Even if they don't engage with the Open Source community directly, their work and trust are built on this shared foundation. It’s critical they understand both the stakes and their ability to support and protect the four freedoms.

## Why This Matters

Protecting the integrity of the Open Source Definition is about more than semantics—it’s about preserving a shared commitment to freedom. With AI systems touching, transforming, and potentially poisoning every aspect of human endeavour, the stakes are high. By supporting this declaration, developers, users, academics, and other stakeholders affirm that true Open Source principles can only be defined by the community itself.

Signing this declaration is an act of support for transparency, collaboration, and the collective ownership of the Open Source ethos. Together, we can ensure that Open Source continues to be shaped by those who build, use, and believe in it, rather than primarily corporate interests. Your support not only affirms your commitment but also sends a message to those who would ignore the community’s voice that it must be heeded.

# *Declaration*

## We, the undersigned members of the Open Source community, assert that Open Source is defined solely by the Open Source Definition (OSD) version 1.9.

## Any amendments or new definitions shall only be recognized if declared by clear community consensus through a transparent process to be determined.
