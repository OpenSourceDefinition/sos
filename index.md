Dear Open Source Friends & Allies,

For over two decades, the Open Source Definition (OSD) has been our shared foundation, safeguarding software freedoms and fostering a collaborative ecosystem. Rooted in the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), the OSD has consistently set the standard for open source, adapting organically as our community has evolved. Yet today, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has today introduced a new and divisive Open Source AI Definition (OSAID), developed through closed-door processes that fundamentally conflict with the principles of openness and transparency that underpin our movement.

The Stewardship Challenge: Inconsistent Representation

OSI’s handling of OSAID has highlighted longstanding issues. Over recent years, OSI’s governance has faced criticism for not fully representing community interests, with controversies including co-founder bans and board member resignations. By neglecting trends like cloud computing—the shift from products to services—and the growing importance of data, OSI has overlooked essential aspects of modern software. Now, with OSAID, OSI is attempting to redefine the concept of openness itself—this time with little regard for feedback that doesn’t align with its predetermined approach to data.

Core Freedoms and Completeness: Ensuring True Freedom

At the heart of open source are the following Four Core Freedoms:

	1.	The freedom to use the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.
	2.	The freedom to study how the system works and inspect its components.
	3.	The freedom to modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.
	4.	The freedom to share the system for others to use, with or without modifications, for any purpose.

These freedoms ensure that users—not just developers—retain control over software. When considering changes to the OSD, it’s essential to address both openness and completeness.

As Bruce Perens, author of the OSD, explains, the completeness of software is already implicit within the definition: data is “source code” when it is integral to modifying and using software. Perens has affirmed that “you can apply the original Open Source Definition to machine learning” and warned that when data and models aren’t accessible, “the result is less than Open Source.”

This framing highlights that the OSD can indeed cover the evolving needs of machine learning without modification, and it’s worth noting that the default—and perhaps recommended—position is to make no changes to the OSD at all. If any updates are made, they should be approached with the same high-bar standards as a constitutional amendment, requiring broad consensus and careful consideration to avoid unintentional disruptions.

Aviate, Navigate, Communicate

In aviation, when pilots encounter an emergency, they follow three steps: Aviate, Navigate, and Communicate. This structured approach applies here as well, helping us regain control, plot a safe path forward, and communicate widely.

	1.	Aviate: The first step is to pull out of the dive and stabilize. This means pausing the rushed introduction of OSAID to maintain the integrity of the OSD. The website https://opensourcedefinition.org serves as a life raft, preserving the current OSD standard and providing the core resources traditionally offered by OSI, plus additional features like a version history and a Git repository. We encourage everyone to clone and widely distribute this CC-BY licensed document, cementing its availability across the community.
	2.	Navigate: With the OSD’s stability restored, we must carefully assess whether the current path still serves all facets of open source. After two decades on this course, minimal adjustments may be needed to expand the OSD’s scope in new areas—such as data and machine learning—without disrupting existing projects. Stability remains our default, and any changes must respect the Four Core Freedoms, avoiding unnecessary disruptions to established norms while gently nudging the OSD into emerging fields. The community will drive this process, and our open, uncensored forums at https://discuss.opensourcedefinition.org are open to all, ensuring every voice can be heard.
	3.	Communicate: Finally, we must educate and engage with all who rely on the OSD. The OSD is the backbone of livelihoods, careers, research, and enterprises across the globe, underpinning the open source ecosystem that sustains the internet, cloud services, AI systems, and more. Many individuals and organizations may have chosen not to participate in recent OSI processes, but their work and trust are built on this shared foundation. It’s critical they understand both the stakes and their ability to support and protect the OSD.

Why This Matters

Protecting the integrity of the OSD is about more than semantics—it’s about preserving a shared commitment to software freedom, resisting commercial pressures, and ensuring that any adaptations come from within the community. By supporting this declaration, developers, users, academics, and other stakeholders affirm that true open source principles can only be defined by the open source community itself.

Signing this declaration is an act of support for transparency, collaboration, and the collective ownership of the open source ethos. Together, we can ensure that open source continues to be shaped by those who build, use, and believe in it.

Declaration
We, the undersigned members of the open source community, assert that Open Source is defined solely by the Open Source Definition (OSD) version 1.9.

Any amendments or new definitions shall only be recognized if declared by clear community consensus through a transparent process yet to be determined.
